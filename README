Documentation
===================================
Complete Doxygen generated documentation (both in HTML and LaTeX
formats) may be found on the doc/ directory in the source code tree.


===================================
Example (build)
===================================
Suppose you have used libcstr on some file foo.c (an example is
provided bellow). The following line should build just fine:

gcc -Wall -pedantic -O2 -o foo foo.c -lcstr


===================================
Example (source)
===================================
/* foo.c */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <cstr.h>

int main()
{
    cstr_t str;
    char *s = "testing, 123\nhello, 456\t\n\tit worked";
    unsigned long int n = 25;

    str = cstrInit();
    cstrImportCharN(str, s, n);
    printf("*");
    cstrDump(str, stdout);
    printf("*");
    printf("\n");
    printf("#%s#, %ld", cstrGetChar(str), cstrLength(str));
    cstrDel(str);

    return 0;
}
